        (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the
        chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order
        of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 A Course of Modern
        Analysis, chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter
        §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section §9.61 treats an
        associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function,
        following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63 introduces Riemann's main
        theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of
        numbering to Giuseppe Peano on their "Contents" page, although this
        attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.[7] Gradshteyn
        and Ryzhik is another book using this scheme since its third edition in
        1951.
